Enables advent calendars on your WordPress blog.

== Description ==
With this plugin you can create a advent calendar on your WP site.

It is using shortcodes, so it is possible to add the calendar to a regular post, a page or any other post type.

Multiple calendars and calendar years are supported.

We have a public git repository at [https://github.com/lostfocus/wp-advent](https://github.com/lostfocus/wp-advent) and we're happy to answer to questions here and there.
Pull requests are obviously also very welcome.
